# Demand-Data-Insights
Drawing insights and make observations from the transactional data and master data.

The objective of this data is to understand the data and supply chain knowledge by looking at how you will draw insights and make observations from the transactional data and master data provided. The data provided was an anonymized data for a large manufacturing and distribution company in India. There were three master data and 12 sales transactional data for each month.

With this data, I used the Python language with 'pandas' library to fetch data from the excel file provided and then append all the transactional data into one data frame. After this, I joined this data frame with the 3 master data by using merge query and applied inner join to join all the data and then exported that data frame into one CSV file which we can use in the Power BI desktop for further analysis.

I have attached the screenshots of the analysis done on various aspects.
